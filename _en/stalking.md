Stalking victims may feel vulnerable and unsafe, and many say they feel they are always looking over their shoulder. Many victims come to believe that the stalking is never going to end, which can lead to feelings of isolation, anger, frustration, depression, and hopelessness.

Stalking victims often experience trouble sleeping, eating, and focusing, or they may have disturbing thoughts and flashbacks. Victims often lose time from work as a result of the stalking.
