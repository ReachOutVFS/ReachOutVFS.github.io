## Domestic Violence

### Introduction

If a man you live with or used to live with (be it a husband, romantic partner, or in-law) is aggressive, threatening or violent towards you, it is domestic violence. 

Under Indian law[^1], domestic violence is anything done by an _adult male_ which causes any kind of _physical or mental harm_ to a woman he currently lives with or has previously lived with in a household. This harm could be: 

- __Physical abuse__: Any action which involves __hurting you, saying they will hurt you and doing anything which is dangerous to your life, body and health__ would be considered physical abuse[^2].
- __Sexual abuse__: Sexual abuse is __any action that forces you to engage in any humiliating and degrading sexual act__. This includes forcing sex on you when you do not want to have sex or performing any sexual activity that you do not want to engage in. It can include your husband forcing you to watch pornography or to perform oral sex or anal sex[^3].
- __Verbal and emotional abuse__: __Insults, name calling, taunting and threatening (but not acting)__ are all forms of verbally abusing someone. When this is __psychological affecting you, your sense of self or self-esteem, it is emotional abuse__[^4].
- __Economic abuse__: Economic abuse is a form of __abuse over economic or monetary resources. It could be in the form of denying access to finances or preventing you from supporting yourself financially__. Some examples are: not giving you money to run your household or for your children, not giving you or letting you use your stridhan (wedding gifts), selling or giving away your household goods or any other asset in which you have an interest, trying to control your money and not letting you live in your shared home.

Coercing or blackmailing the aggrieved person by threatening to harm her or anyone related to her also counts as domestic violence. Not doing something, such as giving access to household finances, can also count as domestic violence. 

### Seeking Help 

1. __File a Domestic Incident Report (DIR)__: A Domestic Incident Report is the first step towards getting relief. It will be prepared based on the complaint of the aggrieved person and will be filed before the magistrate. 
  
    This report is usually prepared with the help of a __Protection Officer__, but you can also take the help of the police or a Service Provider.
  
    A __Protection Officer__ is assigned to each district. You can find the contact information for your district’s protection officer on the [National Commission for Women's website](http://ncw.nic.in/frmListStatePO.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1). In case it is not listed here, contact the __Women and Child Development department__ of your state or access their website.

2. __File a Protection Order__: You can ask the magistrate to file a protection order, which will prohibit your offender from committing further domestic violence and from contacting you. This order is valid until the victim feels comfortable to live without it. It commands the offender[^5]:

    - not to commit or help commit domestic violence;
    - not to disturb the victim at her office, or in the case of a child, not to disturb her at her school;
    - not to contact the victim personally or through email, telephone or similar means;
    - not to do the following without her permission:
    - sell or give away their things, including victim’s stridhan(wedding gifts);
    - use their single/joint bank account.

    Your Protection Officer can help you with this process. (S)he can also help you get legal aid through the State Legal Services Authority. 

3. If you feel unsafe in your shared home or have been forced to leave it, you can __file a residence order__[^6]. This ensures that you are not forced to leave your shared home. Additionally, this can be applied to the offender’s relatives as well to not sell, lease or mortgage the shared home.

    The offender can be forbidden from entering the victim’s portion of the shared home. If need be, the offender can be ordered to pay for or buy another house for the victim.

4. __Seek compensation__: The victim or any person filing the case for her can ask the Magistrate to order the offender to compensate the victim and her children for specific injuries and losses they have been made to suffer. This can be in the form of payment for lost income, hospital bills and money for medicines, property that has been damaged or taken away, and child maintenance[^7].

    Additionally, a __compensatory order__ can be filed. When passed, it orders the offender to pay money to compensate for the mental torture and emotional distress caused.

Apart from these steps, your Protection Officer can help you create a __safety plan__ which has measures to prevent further domestic violence.

In some cases, the Magistrate may order the victim and offender to undergo __counselling with a Service Provider__, free of cost and under the supervision of the court. 

### What do counselors do?

- Counselors help to arrive at a settlement of the dispute by suggesting measures to solve the problem of domestic violence of the victim. 
- They can try and arrive at a settlement if the victim wishes so. The Counselor will do this by taking into account the remedies suggested by the parties for counseling and reformulating the terms for the settlement, wherever required.
- Sessions happen either individually or together.

### Frequent worries:

#### Will I be able to see my children?

Yes, you will. The victim or any person filing the case for her can ask the magistrate to grant __temporary custody__ of the children to them. For permanent custody, a separate case under different laws must be filed. 

The Magistrate can allow or refuse visits from the offender to the children, depending on whether the offender can hurt the children. 

#### Can I get medical aid?

State-designated hospitals must provide medical help to every victim who approaches them, on her own or through Protection Officers or Service Providers. The Protection Officer can help arrange for any transportation required to reach the medical facility or shelter home.

#### Can I stay at a safe place?

The victim can stay at state-designated shelter homes, which have a duty to provide a safe place to her. These can be approached by the victim herself, or through the Protection Officer or Service Provider. 

If you so wish, your identity can remain protected. The shelter home will not disclose it to the offender.
